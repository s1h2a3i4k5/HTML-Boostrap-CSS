                <p>ParagraphParagraphs are the group of sentences combined together, about a certain topic. It is a very
                    important form of writing as we write almost everything in paragraphs, be it an answer, essay,
                    story, emails, etc. We can say that a well-structured paragraph is the essence of good writing. The
                    purposes of the paragraph are to give information, to explain something, to tell a story, and to
                    convince someone that our idea is right.</p>
