                <h2>Introduction to Paragraph Writing</h2>
                <p>ParagraphParagraphs are the group of sentences combined together, about a certain topic. It is a very
                    important form of writing as we write almost everything in paragraphs, be it an answer, essay,
                    story, emails, etc. We can say that a well-structured paragraph is the essence of good writing. The
                    purposes of the paragraph are to give information, to explain something, to tell a story, and to
                    convince someone that our idea Paragraphs are blocks of textual content that segment out a larger
                    piece of writing—stories, novels, articles, creative writing, or professional writing
                    portions—making it less complicated to read and understand. Excellent paragraphs are an available
                    writing skill for plenty of types of literature, and proper writers can substantially beautify the
                    clarity of their news, essays, or fiction writing whilst constructing nicely.</p>

                <h2>Topic Sentence</h2>
                <p>A topic sentence is a precise statement that reflects the main idea of the paragraph. It should be
                    carefully written as it will show the reader what you are going to talk about. Words chosen for this
                    should not be cluttered and ambiguous as readers will decide to read further based on this. It is
                    not necessary to write the topic sentence at the beginning of the paragraph. It can be put anywhere,
                    as long as it reflects the main topic. For instance, if you mention that you are going to talk about
                    the advantages of using the hand sanitizer, then in supporting sentence you should only talk about
                    advantages, not the features or anything else. </p>

                <h2> Supporting Sentences</h2>
                <p>Supporting sentences explain the topic sentence in detail. They expand the main topic and develops
                    the main idea into the explanation. They explain the main topic using examples, facts, quotes, etc.
                    They have to be related to the topic sentence.There can be two types of Supporting sentences, First,
                    The major supporting sentence; this sentence directly explains the main idea with some new fact or
                    new idea. Second, a minor support sentence helps the major supporting sentence develop the
                    controlling idea. </p>

                <h2>What Makes a Paragraph Very Good </h2>
                <p>A perfect and well-written paragraph comprises a key sentence, applicable supporting sentences, and a
                    last (or transition) sentence. This structure is fundamental to maintaining your paragraph centred
                    on the main concept and creating a clear and concise photo.In order to add something interesting,
                    and adding an interesting fact in your content does not
                    necessarily follow the conventional paragraph structure, it’s more about scene building and
                    continuing a story. Properly-written paragraphs are a staple of suitable flash fiction and short
                    fiction writing, as short testimonies need to target a principal concept. When your sentences are
                    unified and connected with other sentences, you can write a good paragraph.</p>
